# Welcome to my online portfolio!

Hi! My name is Mathieu Lavoie and this is the repo of my online portfolio.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm lint`

Runs the lint over the project with both `eslint` and `stylelint` to make sure your eyes are happy reading the code.
